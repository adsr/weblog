<p>Well, Mara, they&rsquo;re mine, from a series I did last year futzing with old polaroids. If I had the inclination I would say &ldquo;distressing expired filmstock.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-342"></a></p>

<p>That was last year around this time, or a little later, in a burst of uncharacteristically fretless output, that I&rsquo;d like to get to more often, pun intended and I mean both ways this is a poorly written sentence.</p>

<p>Mostly I pressed the chemicals around in there using a wacom stylus and a flat edge on a salt shaker. I&rsquo;ve always been rotten at drawing, but this was mostly abstract enough for me to do it.Â I really loved the effect so I made about 60 of them, although the vast majority are, shall we say, aesthetically inferior <em>ahemcrapahem</em>&hellip; but enough turned out to make it worth the time.</p>

<p>There is also something rattling around in my brain about being open to inspiration from unconventional media, like when my microwave hums a closed position major seventh chord, which is really weird cause it only does that when I put vegetarian gyoza in there&hellip; go figure&hellip;</p>

<p>I finished a nine panel one that the title bar is taken from first:</p>

<p>And then made I think 5 or 6 to mail to some folks, but I don&rsquo;t remember who got what, so maybe let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Also, best of luck with your own V-I, we&rsquo;re all in this together.</p>
