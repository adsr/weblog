<p>Jeff Atwood, of Coding Horror fame, wrote a blogpost called &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">Why Can&rsquo;t
Programmers..
Program?</a>&rdquo;, by a
happy coincidence nearly exactly 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Central to the post is the assertion that candidates for development jobs
should be initially screened on tasks that any remotely experienced programmer
might (many would say should) consider low hanging fruit, the canonical example
offered being &ldquo;FizzBuzz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think that the specification for the problem is pretty universally known
at this point, mostly due to the linked post above, but it&rsquo;s short and simple
enough to allow a quick repeat here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Print the numbers 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with &ldquo;Fizz&rdquo;,
multiples of 5 with &ldquo;Buzz, and multiples of both 3 and 5 with &ldquo;FizzBuzz.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by this post, having read it very early on in
learning to program myself, and coming away heartened about my chances of being
&ldquo;up to snuff&rdquo; after solving fizzbuzz over beers one night while exploring the
idea of a career change with a programmer friend.</p>

<p>At the time, I was incredulous that that was all it might take to prove a
minimal competence. Jeff does a fine job extolling the efficacy of this level
of screening and discussing both why it might be necessary and also why it
totally shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary. It&rsquo;s worth a read if you haven&rsquo;t seen that post
before. I&rsquo;m not entirely on board with the
<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/">essentialism</a>
being implied, but there&rsquo;s definitely not nothing to the main point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more interested, though, in the follow up. The very next day, Jeff published a post called
<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven/">FizzBuzz: the Programmer&rsquo;s Stairway to
Heaven</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidently writing about the FizzBuzz problem on a programming blog results in a
nigh-irresistible urge to code up a solution. The comments here, on Digg, and
on Reddit – nearly a thousand in total – are filled with hastily coded
solutions to FizzBuzz. Developers are nothing if not compulsive problem
solvers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. There are <em>so many</em> solutions, in all manner of languages. They mostly
look the same because of course they do- it is, after all, just Fizzbuzz, ffs, right?
There is a spin off Discourse thread called <a href="https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/fizzbuzz-solution-dumping-ground/1752">FizzBuzz Solution
Dumping
Ground</a>
in which there are currently 262 posts. Some of them seem to bespeak of some <a href="https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven/611/3">pretty deep
insecurities</a>,
some of them carry a light stink of what you might call &lsquo;<a href="https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/fizzbuzz-solution-dumping-ground/1752/73">smug
asshole</a>&rsquo;,
even while kowtowing to the snipe hunt. The most recent post is from March 6, 2017. An
incredible ten whole years of Fizzbuzz.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> a little weird, really&hellip; why <em>do</em> so many people respond to the post
as if it&rsquo;s a challenge?</p>

<h2 id="improvisation-and-levity">Improvisation and Levity</h2>

<p>Jazz is an old form, now, or at least it is heading there. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Songbook">The Great American
Songbook</a> still has
<em>some</em> room for additions, but rarely accepts them, and it is generally thought
of as being canonical, and at this point, historical.</p>

<p>These capital-S Standards are standards because they are well known, having originally
come from the pop music of the day. As jazz tunes, they serve as
improvisational vehicles, providing the structure and outline inside of which
an improvising musician can play extemporaneously. They remain standards in that
capacity by serving as a common repertoire between jazz musicians, regardless
of their differing backgrounds or generations or usually even jazz styles.</p>

<p>This type of lyric standard is just one type of jazz music, of course. We learn
the melody, it&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s hummable, it comes out <em>kind of</em> the same way each
time. The melodies are poppy, memorable, and in many cases quite simple, in
contrast to the often frenetic bebop standards, or modal tunes, or maybe latin
big band, or fusion&hellip; the subgenre list could continue indefinitely.</p>

<p>But lyric standards like the ones in the Great American songbook provide a
template for the whole endeavor, a sort of blueprint for how to improvise over
<em>any</em> tune. They&rsquo;re often used as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3vL8guiFFM&amp;list=RDe3vL8guiFFM#t=7">pedagogical
tools</a> and
as some of the first songs young musicians become acquainted with, while still
remaining perennial set list favorites for musicians of the highest
caliber.</p>

<p>A great improvisation will not just be riffs over the chord changes. The real
goal is to move and flow with the implicit melodic outline, following the
contours and implying the structure of the melody while playing inside of and
around the harmony.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s guitarist Gilad Hekselman demonstrating this concept in a workshop over
the tune &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtWpgWjxouY">It Could Happen to
You</a>&rdquo; &hellip; listen to how he builds
up a vocabulary that seems to belong just to this song over the course of
a few choruses, each one getting a little bit further afield but maintaining
the central cohesiveness of the overarching motive:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTg3VV5v-jM?start=76&rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Listen to how he bobs and weaves around the structure of the song but is always
hinting back at the melody, maintaining that thread, reinforcing that shape. It
gets pretty out there, but it&rsquo;s still the same song.</p>

<p>Sonny Rollins is an acknowledged master of this type of thematic improvisation.
Here&rsquo;s an excellent
<a href="http://jazzstudiesonline.org/files/jso/resources/pdf/SonnyRollinsAndChallengeOfThematicImprov.pdf">paper</a>
by Gunther Schuller discussing him in this context.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;standard&rsquo; way to play standards is to play the melody first (the &lsquo;head&rsquo;)
and then to improvise over the form of the song, possibly taking turns, and
then to end the tune by playing the &lsquo;head out&rsquo;, recapitulating the melody a
final time. But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be that way. One of my favorite
records is from Lee Konitz, recorded in 1961, called &ldquo;Motion.&rdquo; Lee is from a
different school, a little more deconstructive. Even back then
he was just launching <em>right into</em> the improvisation, as if to say &ldquo;alright
alright we all know this tune lets get on with it.&rdquo;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5tT00jXEkU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>He actually doesn&rsquo;t even play the melody <em>at all</em> until the very very end-
practically at the last second&hellip; starting at about 7:39, and even then it&rsquo;s
sparse- just one <code>A</code> section and a few flutters and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll permit that this is pretty inside baseball and winky. Not everyone
listening knows the song, and certainly not everyone can hear the changes
happening underneath the improvisation and place the song just by that. But
it&rsquo;s also really cool!</p>

<p>I photographed Lee Konitz in his apartment once for a magazine article. When we
got there we asked him what he had been practicing that day. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhBQd2VMWzA">All the things
you are</a>&rdquo; he said. He&rsquo;s been
playing that old song for <em>decades</em>, and he&rsquo;s <em>still</em> playing it.</p>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3027/5759834284_10d0bd10d6.jpg" alt="Lee Konitz in his apartment"></p>

<p>Fizzbuzz is <em>not</em> a hard problem. It&rsquo;s an <em>easy</em> problem. You have to know what
you&rsquo;re doing to program Fizzbuzz in the same way you have to know what you&rsquo;re
doing to program anything&hellip; you need to know your tools and have a functional
mental model of programming and understand some rudimentary control flow
concepts. If Fizzbuzz as a task is testing anything at all, it&rsquo;s really testing
<em>that</em>, and that&rsquo;s fine. Fizzbuzz is easy, sure, but it&rsquo;s also not entirely
dissimilar to workaday programming tickets I might see from time to time.
&ldquo;Filter out users who aren&rsquo;t signed in and redirect them to the login page&rdquo;
maybe, or &ldquo;catch these two exceptions for special treatment and disregard any
others thrown,&rdquo; or any number of other things. These types of tickets also
aren&rsquo;t necessarily <em>difficult</em>, but they&rsquo;re certainly a part of my day to day
life.</p>

<p>But I think there&rsquo;s more to it than that.</p>

<p>Fizzbuzz is a melody; it&rsquo;s a short and easy to remember little song. Much like a
simple tune can become an ideal vehicle for improvisation and caprice precisely
<em>because</em> it&rsquo;s a simple tune, and not in spite of it, there is something about
the structure and simplicity of fizzbuzz that gets you thinking&hellip; what if I
did it like this? or that? or I wonder if I could do it using that other thing&hellip;</p>

<p>Have you seen <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">FizzBuzz Enterprise
Edition</a>
from Enterprise Quality Coding? It&rsquo;s a hoot. There are 99 files in that repo,
and they&rsquo;re <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition/pulls">still receiving pull
requests</a>.
And yeah, last time I checked at least, it ran.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse Center</a> uses Fizzbuzz during its
prelimenary <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply">application process</a> both as a
screening question and as an opportunity for displaying creativity, although they&rsquo;ve
changed the terms to &lsquo;CracklePop&rsquo; to thwart would be plagiarizers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, now, that despite my waxing on <em>why</em> so many people responded to that
post with fizzbuzz solutions, <a href="https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/fizzbuzz-solution-dumping-ground/1752/192">I couldn&rsquo;t resist it any better than they
could</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-great-programmer-song-book">The Great Programmer Song Book</h2>

<p>Fizzbuzz isn&rsquo;t alone in this song book, far from it. It belongs to a subclass of
programming problems that have this some kind of, for lack of a better word,
&lsquo;poppiness&rsquo; to them. They may be but don&rsquo;t have to be easy to complete, but
they&rsquo;re memorable for sure&hellip; easy to &lsquo;hum.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Another like this is the eight queens problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Place eight queens on an 8 by 8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 92 and only 92 ways to do this. The problem could be &ldquo;find one
solution&rdquo; or it could be &ldquo;find all solutions&rdquo; or it could be &ldquo;find all
solutions that are not rotations of any previously found solutions.&rdquo; It could
be generalized to be the &ldquo;n-queens&rdquo; problem&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Place <em>n</em> queens on an <em>x</em> by <em>y</em> chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could allow the chess board to be a non-rectangular shape, or it could
be 3 dimensions, or it could be <code>n</code> dimensions. You could code golf it, you
could try to get it to run as fast as possible, you could subject yourself to
arbitrary constraints in the language you&rsquo;re using just to see if you can do
it.  It&rsquo;s naturally a recursive problem, but you could solve it iteratively.</p>

<p>There are <em>tons</em> of ways to play through this song, but the melody is always
there.</p>

<p><a href="http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/02/25/overkilling-the-8-queens-problem/">Here&rsquo;s a solution by David
Dalrymple</a>
written directly in x86 Assembly that may very well run faster than any other
solution ever.</p>

<p><a href="http://acmonette.com/here-there-be-pydras.html">Here&rsquo;s one by Andree Monette</a>
that uses Python&rsquo;s garbage collector as a computational stack and produces the
correct value on exit of the program.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview">here&rsquo;s one by
Aphyr</a> posted not
but a couple of days ago that&hellip; well I&rsquo;ll let that one speak for itself.</p>

<p>There are <em>so many</em> ways to solve it, to &lsquo;improvise&rsquo; around the &lsquo;melody.&rsquo;
Improvise might be a strange word to hear in this context, as it tends to imply
performance, or at least making things up in the moment, on the spot. But
really, that&rsquo;s inconsequential. Improvisation and composition are not exactly the same
thing, but they are inextricable, they have a <em>lot</em> in common with each other,
they just happen on different time scales. What I&rsquo;m trying to get at is the
sense of play, the chasing down of an idea just for the fun of it, or for the
shape of it, or for the challenge of it.  Are these things necessary? No, of
course not. Programming can be aesthetic, and it can be playful, and in a sense
it can be improvisatory too. Just because something is a solved problem, and
certainly fizzbuzz and 8-queens are solved problems, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not
worth spending time on them for creativity&rsquo;s and learning&rsquo;s sakes.</p>

<p>How about Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life? Here&rsquo;s a demonstration of an implementation of
that in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9xAKttWgP4">APL</a>. I must have watched
that video a dozen times and it still melts my brain.</p>

<p>The change counting problem from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node16.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</a> is a
good candidate, as is the related <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/">n&rsquo;th
stair</a> problem. There
are a lot!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly how to best describe the qualities that make a problem or
puzzle or task feel like a &lsquo;standard,&rsquo; and I suspect that they are different
for different people with different backgrounds, too. Just like a fusion
musician might have a different set of songs they know backwards and forwards,
a graphics programmer might consider a ray tracer to be a standard&hellip; a
language designer might consider a lisp interpreter to be one. I know that a
lot of these tasks could be interview problems, too, but that&rsquo;s also not a
complete overlap.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very interested to hear what people think about what exactly falls into this category!</p>

<h2 id="code-as-craft-coda">Code as Craft / Coda</h2>

<p>I came across a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow">Longfellow</a> verse
today in a <a href="https://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/bullshit/pdf/on-bullshit.pdf">book</a>
I was leafing through&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>In the elder days of art
Builders wrought with greatest care
Each minute and unseen part
For the Gods are everywhere.
</code></pre>

<p>The author quotes the verse and goes on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point of these lines is clear. In the old days, craftsmen did not cut
corners.  They worked carefully, and they took care with every aspect of their
work. Every part of the product was considered, and each was designed and made
to be exactly as it should be. These craftsmen did not relax their thoughtful
self-discipline even with respect to features of their work which would
ordinarily not be visible.  Although no one would notice if those features were
not quite right, the craftsmen would be bothered by their consciences.</p>

<p>As I was writing this post I found myself linking to a ton of youtube videos of
music. It got a little overwhelming, so I pared it down quite a bit. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVm2QnrDZ4RSqtJw_m5dsrT0HRc40La7q">put
them all in this

though, if you&rsquo;re interested. Obviously this is pretty limited and not intended
to be a survey of jazz history or styles or anything, but just to illustrate
the concepts I was trying to get at.</p>
