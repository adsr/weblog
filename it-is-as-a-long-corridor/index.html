                    <p>In late 2006, I said goodbye to my friends, and my girlfriend, and my family,
and I walked down this passage at the airport in Raleigh, North Carolina, to
fly to Japan for two years.</p>

<p>It was already after CD&rsquo;s, and she had made me a playlist. I remember - it was
this song as I took the picture in the passage, and it was when I took the
picture in the passage that I realized I was leaving. August 29, 2006. At 11:05
pm, to be precise&hellip; (why don&rsquo;t I ever properly set the time zone on my
cameras, I wonder, now?)</p>

<p>There were no titles on the list, so for years I didn&rsquo;t know the name of that
song, until shazam at least. But I often think of it when my life is changing;
when I&rsquo;m going somewhere&hellip; when things are never going to be the same.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I was in seventh grade, we were all shuffled into the gym to hear the high
school jazz band perform. It was fine. It was great. I enjoyed it. But then
Gray Currin played Stairway to Heaven. Don&rsquo;t laugh. I didn&rsquo;t know yet. I hadn&rsquo;t
seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1KqbDdmuE">Waynes World</a>; I had never
even heard the original song. How could someone barely older than me do that? I
was <em>amazed</em>. I wished I could do that. And then, a little voice. My voice. In
my head: &ldquo;<em>Why couldn&rsquo;t you?</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>I was a slightly morose kid. I wasn&rsquo;t given to flights of fancy&hellip; this was a
new feeling for me. And so I did it. 3 years later I played the same song in
the same gym with the same band. I never stopped playing; I never will stop
playing.</p>

<p>A little under a year ago, Yuri came back to New York and got a job as a Python
developer. I told him how impressed I was (and I <em>was</em>, and I <em>am</em>) - he
essentially picked it up on his own, after all. I had always wanted to learn
more about computers&hellip; they&rsquo;ve always fascinated me&hellip; but it is so much&hellip; it
is too hard&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have time&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you could!&rdquo; Yuri told me, and he gave me a few little puzzles and
problems and riddles. I solved all of them, and then I went online and found
some more and I solved those too. And then a week later I found the original
Cue programming challenge on a message board, and I stayed up until 7 the next
morning solving <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; the browser said chipperly &ldquo;Please send us your resume!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>A little voice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent hundreds of hours at the keyboard since last May. I&rsquo;ve spent dozens
of nights playing with code until dawn. I&rsquo;ve never been able to focus this much
on anything else, other than music and my instrument, and tomorrow I get to
keep focusing on it with around 60 other people from all over the world and
from a crazy cross section of fascinating disciplines&hellip; because tomorrow is
the first day of <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>, and I am so
excited about it. Introductory emails have been coming in for a while, and I am
simply blown away by the people with whom I get to spend the next 3 months- and
humbled to be counted amongst them. I have no idea what we&rsquo;re going to end up
working on, though I have some inclinations, but I sure am looking forward to
finding out.</p>

<p>Yuri, and Gabe Herrera, and Andrew Madden: Thank you. all three of you offered
votes of confidence at the right times. At just the right times.</p>

<p>And a public thanks to the <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/">Wix Lounge</a>- a place
that is, quizzically, what it says on the tin. I spent a <em>lot</em> of days there,
and it was a true help.</p>

<p>And to my cohort: I hope the coffee tomorrow is strong, because I think quite a
few of us are not going to be sleeping much.</p>
