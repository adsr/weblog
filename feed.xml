      <description>Hello and good morning or whatever! Let&amp;rsquo;s write a brainfuck interpreter. &amp;ldquo;Why are you doing this?&amp;rdquo; you might say, but you won&amp;rsquo;t find that answer here.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to make it in Zig.
Zig is&amp;hellip;. &amp;hellip;new, still very much in beta, and moving quickly. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen any Zig previously, the code in this post might look quite different. It is different! Zig 0.2.0 has just been released, coinciding with the release of LLVM 6 a few weeks ago, and includes a lot of changes to the syntax and general improvements to the language.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing this blog for a while now, and put it through several different blogging engines and style changes. Wordpress, Middleman, Jekyll&amp;hellip; and finally to Hugo, which I&amp;rsquo;m using currently. I feel it should be really easy to switch platforms (where &amp;ldquo;really easy&amp;rdquo; means like, a week or two of fiddly work), and I fully expect to do so again when it becomes worth the trouble to do it, whenever and whyever that may be.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Monado</title>

      <description>I have recently come into possession of a reasonably sound understanding of monads. Tradition dictates that I now have an obligation to write a blog post/tutorial/thing about them, wherein I attempt to gracefully share this nascent knowledge through the judicious use of carefully chosen metaphors and examples. Legend has it that I will inevitably fail in this, and then be raked over the coals for my sins by both category theorists and Haskellers alike.</description>
