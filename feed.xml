      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing this blog for a while now, and put it through several different blogging engines and style changes. Wordpress, Middleman, Jekyll&amp;hellip; and finally to Hugo, which I&amp;rsquo;m using currently. I feel it should be really easy to switch platforms (where &amp;ldquo;really easy&amp;rdquo; means like, a week or two of fiddly work), and I fully expect to do so again when it becomes worth the trouble to do it, whenever and whyever that may be.</description>

      <description>I have recently come into possession of a reasonably sound understanding of monads. Tradition dictates that I now have an obligation to write a blog post/tutorial/thing about them, wherein I attempt to gracefully share this nascent knowledge through the judicious use of carefully chosen metaphors and examples. Legend has it that I will inevitably fail in this, and then be raked over the coals for my sins by both category theorists and Haskellers alike.</description>

      <description>September update: After a short but intense job hunt, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say I&amp;rsquo;ll be starting work with Peakon at their beautiful office in Copenhagen in a few weeks! Thanks to all who shared and read this post, it was a vast help to me.
 After 9 years in New York, I am leaving for good on August 1st, when I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving to Copenhagen with my wife and cat.</description>
