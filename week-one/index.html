                    <p>So, week one is already over, and it went by pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Anyway, week in review- what have I learned so far, concretely?</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;git add -p&rsquo; for reviewing each and every change you made before committing it</li>
<li>&lsquo;git commit &ndash;amend&rsquo; for opening up your last commit and making changes to it</li>
<li>&lsquo;Ctrl+R&rsquo; to search through old CLI commands</li>
<li>&lsquo;diff&rsquo;</li>
<li>what a &lsquo;trie&rsquo; is</li>
<li>what a &lsquo;queue&rsquo; is</li>
<li>depth-first vs breadth-first search</li>
<li>that vim doesn&rsquo;t source my .zshrc by default</li>
<li>state-machine</li>
<li>void returns in C</li>
<li>the basics of list comprehensions in Python</li>
<li>etc etc etc&hellip; and on and on and on&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>these are just <em>facts</em>, and random things, but they are actual tidbits of knowledge that I actually remember because I learned them &lsquo;in the stream,&rsquo; as it were.</p>

<p>This is a funny place to be, but it feels really natural&hellip; everything you do here is one hundred percent your own decision. It&rsquo;s incredible to note that <em>everyone</em> is working <em>all the time</em>. The real time chat we use is constantly on fire with threads about all kinds of arcana from assembly specs to keyboard reviews to places to eat lunch.</p>

<p>Also, I got to try an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcOMOWRMnA">Oculus Rift</a>, which was <em>totally rad</em>.</p>

<p>The question of what exactly to work on while here is a big one- but there is certainly no lack of ideas. Every single person I talked to was working on something interesting, and the huge variance in people&rsquo;s backgrounds virtually guarantees that you can both learn something from and teach something to anyone in the room.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been going through the last couple of chapters of <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a> and hope to have the book done in the next couple of days so that I don&rsquo;t have to think about it anymore. It&rsquo;s been an <em>incredible</em> learning experience, but I do want to maximize the time that I spend pairing and shipping while I&rsquo;m here, and nand feels like it&rsquo;s best done on one&rsquo;s own and in isolation (at least, that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve enjoyed doing it&hellip; though the toolset that I composed with Ruby is <em>really, really</em> ugly and could use a refactor really badly!)</p>

<p>More later on specifics&hellip; I want to write a booklist of all the things I&rsquo;ve read so far and all the things I hope to read, and hopefully in the next couple of weeks I&rsquo;ll be able to get some clarity on what exactly I want to work towards and what I want to learn- or at least narrow the scope of those things to a manageable point.</p>

<p>Tonight, though, it&rsquo;s my birthday. So I&rsquo;m trudging out in the cold and getting some sushi. Had a preemptive small party last weekend with lots of singing and nerdery, and I&rsquo;ll post some videos from that pretty soon. It&rsquo;s pretty fun to get a room full of musicians drunk and then play &ldquo;lets listen to a song once and then play a fully realized arrangement of it yay lets go GO HARMONY EVERYWHERE!</p>
