title: moving to denmark

After 9 years in New York, I am leaving for good on August 1st, when I'll be
moving to Copenhagen with my wife and cat.

I'll be looking for engineering work in the coming weeks and months. I'm hoping
to find a job somewhere that is...

- Small enough for me to have a big impact on but big enough to offer a measure
of stability<sup>1</sup>

...that is...

- working on something familiar enough for me have an immediate impact at a
  senior level but also on something that I could learn a lot from.

I am open to working remotely if it's the right situation, but I think I would
probably be happier, more productive, and benefit more from working IRL in
Copenhagen right now.

At [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) I primarily worked as a product engineer on
[Etsy Manufacturing](https://www.etsy.com/manufacturing), a matchmaking service
intended to connect makers with manufacturers who have the tools and knowledge
to help them scale up their businesses in a sustainable and transparent way.
[Here's a New York Times
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/etsy-welcomes-manufacturers-to-artisanal-fold.html)
that was written about it when we initially launched.

While there, I split pretty evenly between the front and back ends, and
I also had many opportunities to be exposed to a lot of other tools and stacks
and types of work, from data analytics and A/B testing to infrastructure and
operations.  Ask me about it!

You can find many examples of my side projects, communication style, and
thought process on this blog. I think my favorites right now are [The Mandelwat
Set](/the-mandelwat-set/), which was republished in
[DailyJS](https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-mandelwat-set-c3037204bf83), the [Sild
series](/sild-is-a-list/), for which I wrote about 80,000 words on implementing an
interpreted lisp from scratch, and [How React Do?](/how-react-do/), which is my
attempt to figure out React from something resembling first-ish principles.

I like to work on interesting products that people use, and I love to learn. If
you know anyone in Copenhagen who I should talk to, [please let me know](mailto:jeffowler@gmail.com)!

[Here's my resume](/resume.pdf).

<sup>1</sup> _As a former professional musician, my idea of "stability" is
probably way, way less stable than yours for most values of_ `$you`. _What I really
mean here is "Can reasonably be expected to offer 2-3 years of some amount of
job security."_
