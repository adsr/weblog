                <div>
                    <p>I spent a huge chunk of my time today fussing over this site design. Back and forth and back and forth&hellip; writing everything from scratch or using a static generator or going back to wordpress&hellip;</p>

<p>And aaaaah it was <strong>so frustrating</strong>. But <strong>why</strong>?? What do I <strong>want</strong> out of the design of this site that I haven&rsquo;t quite yet been able to achieve? I have some thoughts&hellip;</p>

<p>I think, that it has a lot to do with the uneasy relationship I have to design and productive visual communication in general. I never thought of myself as possessing <strong>any talent at all</strong> in art or design or even fingerpainting while growing up- my handwriting was atrocious, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy sketching or drawing&hellip; and so I didn&rsquo;t seek out guidance on how to get better at any of those things.</p>

<p>Even after I got interested in photography, I felt removed from design and visual art in a fundamental way- photography, after all, is taking a scene in and reducing it into a frame; it is by its very nature reductive, whereas I always considered the core skill sets of good visual design to be constructive: the blank canvas and all that.</p>

<p>Photography <strong>did</strong> develop my aesthetics regarding form and structure, composition and weight&hellip; but having never had any formal instruction in <strong>any</strong> visual art, I never really attained a vocabulary for thinking about nor framework for actualizing those aesthetics. Not that I think formal instruction is necessary for skill acquisition- I don&rsquo;t&hellip; and I could have, and still could, you know, read a book, or something&hellip; it is just that I have yet to become good at trusting myself to <strong>make design decisions in general.</strong></p>

<p>Every webpage is a blank canvas, and I have enough different brushes to make, well&hellip; something, I guess&hellip;</p>

<p>Well anyway, this is all to say that- generally, I&rsquo;m fairly happy with this site now. I hope. It looks a lot like it looked before, but I&rsquo;ve begun using Middleman as a static generator instead of Jekyll. So far so good- it&rsquo;s definitely less bloated (even though Jekyll really wasn&rsquo;t that bloated- I was coming from wordpress after all&hellip;)</p>

<p>But it is also to say, to my design friends in particular, that feedback is welcome, specific or general. I would have a great interest in pursuing at least some informal study of design principles, but I don&rsquo;t know where to start really.</p>

<p>And also, that blogging. Yes blogging. We&rsquo;re doing blogging now. I&rsquo;m going to do the blogging now. I am. It is happening. You will know that I am blogging well proper, because I will have too many commas, and that is your hint that I am writing, perhaps thoughtfully, but still in a conversational, flowing style, without regard to the grammarian living inside of my lit degree.</p>
