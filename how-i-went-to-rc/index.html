                    <h1>How I went to the Recurse Center</h1>
                    <sub>May 18, 2016 </sub>
                <p>
                <div>
                    <p>I wrote a <a href="/corridor">post</a> about going to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse
Center</a> (n√©e Hacker School) the night before I
started my batch. I stand behind it, there were some good feels in there.  But
I never wrote about <em>how I got there</em>. Which, if I were me reading my own post
a year prior, I would, like, you know, really wanted to have known <em>that</em>. I&rsquo;ve
been meaning to write this post for <em>years</em> now, which is ridiculous, but
better late than never?</p>

<p>This is written very procedurally: I did this, then this happened, then I did
that. I don&rsquo;t mean to give the impression that it wasn&rsquo;t difficult, or that I never
questioned what I was doing, because I did, a lot. And it was one of the more
difficult things I&rsquo;ve done in my life, most likely. But this post isn&rsquo;t about
that part of the process, it&rsquo;s just about <em>what</em> I did in that almost a year.
It&rsquo;s also not about <em>why</em> I did it. That&rsquo;s another subject. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write
about that sometime, too, but not right now.</p>

<p>I would like this post to be interesting for someone who may be thinking about
a career switch via RC or a bootcamp, but may not know too much about what that
might mean concretely. Or also interesting for someone who knows me and
wonders how I went from a full time musician to a full time engineer in about
a year. I haven&rsquo;t talked about it much; I&rsquo;m not so natural a self promoter, as
it turns out.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the Spring of 2013, I couldn&rsquo;t <code>ls</code>. I hadn&rsquo;t programmed anything since a
Qbasic class I took in probably 4th grade, and the only program I could remember was</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-basic" data-lang="basic"><span></span><span class="nl">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">PRINT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;HELLO&quot;</span>
<span class="nl">20</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">GOTO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">10</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or something like that.</p>

<p>The very first thing that got my wheels turning on this- it was around January
of 2013 or so, maybe&hellip; I was working on permutations of different four voiced
chordal structures on the guitar, mostly by hand and in my head, trying to come
up with a relatively complete set. Any shape would have one of</p>

<pre><code>7  different chord qualities
4  different inversions (including root position)
12 different root notes
4  different voicings
</code></pre>

<p>The specifics of these, while interesting and certainly blogelaboutable, are not
pertinent right now. Just &hellip; I wanted to figure out a lot of different
permutations. For any given chord, I could see how it fell along these
dimensions easily, but I was trying to figure out <em>everything</em> because I am a
commited completest sometimes, and also I wanted to build some practice plans
around them.</p>

<p>I thought, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have all these in a spreadsheet or something?
That would take forever to write out. This is like, the perfect thing to make a
computer do for me, right? I called my old buddy
<a href="http://stacoscimus.com/">Yuri</a>, a fine musician and bash scriptor, and he
recited a one liner over the phone that did exactly what I wanted:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="o">{</span>A,Bb,B,C,Db,D,Eb,E,F,Gb,G,Ab<span class="o">}{</span>M7,m7,7,m7b5,dim7,mM7,M7#5<span class="o">}</span>_<span class="o">{</span><span class="m">0</span>,1,2,3<span class="o">}</span>_<span class="o">{</span>drop2,drop2/3,drop2/4,drop3/4<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This was completely incomprehensible to me at the time, as I was
still afraid of opening the terminal, but that didn&rsquo;t matter, because <em>it
totally worked</em>. I had my giant list of voicings! This got my wheels turning.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sometime a few weeks after that I stumbled on an article about the then new to
NY <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/03/free-learn-to-code-boot-camp/">App Academy</a>. I
hadn&rsquo;t heard of the bootcamp model before then, but was heartened to learn
about their &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t owe us until you get a job&rdquo; payment structure. There was
no way I could afford a 10-15 thousand dollar course up front, but this seemed
doable. The very next day I applied, and they wrote back promptly with
instructions on preparing for and taking an initial coding challenge. What they
sent wasn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> as fleshed out as what they have available now, but basically
it was <a href="http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/">this stuff</a>.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of weeks going through those materials and completed the
challenge. They again got back promptly, this time asking me to do a
second one. At this point, I was pretty chuffed! I had begun to start
thinking about this path as something that might be not only <em>possible</em> but
<em>really fun</em>. I hadn&rsquo;t told anyone but Yuri about <em>any</em> of this yet.</p>

<p>I went through the <a href="http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-2/">materials</a>
for the second challenge.</p>

<p>I bought the books they recommended: Chris Pine&rsquo;s
<a href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Learn to Program</a> and Peter Cooper&rsquo;s
<a href="http://peterc.org/beginningruby/">Beginning Ruby</a></p>

<p>I worked through them voraciously. I think they also recommended
<a href="http://tryruby.org">tryruby.com</a>,
and I found that to be really helpful, as well. And at some point I found
<a href="http://poignant.guide">Why&rsquo;s Poignant Guide</a>, which is a little dated now but
is still a really sweet and weird book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is particularly awesome that this is still available, as the author has
since disappeared from public (internet public, at least), life. There is a
longform article about it
<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.html">here</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a lot all at once, and it was very overwhelming at times. When I looked
at the <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/immersive/curriculum">curriculum</a>, I saw a <em>whole bunch
of idk</em> and quite a bit of <em>wtf</em>. But I had told myself that I was at least
going to try it. I had been asked to do a second test, so I must not be
abysmal, right?</p>

<p>It was also during this period that I experienced my first real <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd
snipe</a>. On some message board or another, I found a link
to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/08/programming-challenges-benefit-job-seekers-and-employers/">Cue programming
challenge</a>.
I had been tackling little puzzles using my nascent ruby, and as I read the
first problem, I remember thinking &ldquo;wow that seems really hard, but I guess if
I started by doing <em>x</em> and then did <em>y</em>&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stayed up all night solving the three problems. Each solution would unlock
the next tier. It was wicked fun! After putting in the last solution, I got a
prompt asking me to send in my resume; I had had no idea it was a job screen,
at all! This is when I realized that being a programmer was something
that I was capable of, and that it was something that I would enjoy, and that
it was something that I could do for a job.</p>

<p>There was no deadline for the second challenge, so I spent about 3 months
working through all those resources. I didn&rsquo;t want to half ass it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to note here that <em>all of this</em> was Ruby. That&rsquo;s why I learned Ruby first.
I really like Ruby. I still like Ruby; it&rsquo;s still the first thing I reach for
when just sketching out ideas. I would recommend Python or Ruby as a
great first language to anyone, but between the two of them I started with
Ruby because almost all the bootcamps taught Ruby and App Academy taught Ruby
and all of their preperation materials were in Ruby. It would probably have
been Python if not for these factors. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, I took the second challenge, and though I don&rsquo;t think I <em>bombed</em> it,
exactly, I didn&rsquo;t do that great, either. I wasn&rsquo;t invited to an interview. This
was a huge disappointment, but not really a surprise; I had been programming
for about a month, after all, and programming is hard, right? That had always
been my understanding.</p>

<p>I had been doing research about other bootcamps and programs this whole time.
Most of them were pay up front, which made them impossible for me to attend.
But one of them wasn&rsquo;t, because one of them was the Recurse Center, and the
Recurse Center is free, completely and no strings attached, to attend.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how I found them first. There aren&rsquo;t <em>that</em> many things
online. I do remember finding this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jds52EW1yzM">video</a>
and being really inspired by it.</p>

<p>And then I read their <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">manual</a>, which really,
really resonated for me, and I decided to apply.</p>

<hr>

<p>RC has (and had) very different <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat">application criteria</a>.</p>

<p>Some semi-open ended get to know you prompts, a Fizzbuzz code screen, and
linking to a project that you built from scratch. I hadn&rsquo;t built any projects
from scratch, so I spent a few weeks building a program that could compute some
of the chord structures that Yuri&rsquo;s bash one liner could output, and display
them via ASCII art. I called it <a href="https://github.com/urthbound/chorder">Chorder</a>
and it used a GUI library that I found out later was by why the lucky stiff.</p>

<p>At the time, RC had a three step process.  Initial application screening, and
then two skype interviews- the first just a chat about your background and
goals and the second a pairing session with one of the facilitators on
something that you were working on.</p>

<p>I submitted this stuff, along with a lot of ideas I had about what I might work
on while I was there, and waited. I got a first interview. I talked to
<a href="http://maryrosecook.com/">Mary</a> for a while. It went ok; she was very nice. I
wasn&rsquo;t invited to do a second interview. I was even more disappointed this
time, I had started to develop an attachment to this whole idea.</p>

<p>While talking to Mary, I had asked explicitly if it was possible to reapply,
and she had said that people often do improve and get in on a second attempt.
So I sent Mary a follow up email, asking for feedback.</p>

<p>A few days later she wrote back. Posted with her permission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jeff,</p>

<p>You seemed to be focused on building things, rather than learning to program.
We love it when people make stuff at Hacker School.  But, we try to admit
people who are obsessed with programming for its own sake.  Having the goals
for the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; be important as well as the learning goals can mean that the
learning goals suffer.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Mary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This made me <em>very, very</em> happy. She had no way of knowing this, but I had gone
<em>way</em> out of my way to emphasize the projects I had ideas about working on, because
I thought that that would show that I had direction, and plans! The truth is
that when I really get interested in something, I just kind of want to dive in and
meander around in it and try to learn about it through trial and error, but I
had spent so many years in institutions where this approach is looked down on,
that I thought it would better to deemphasize that.</p>

<p>I decided then that I would reapply for both App Academy and the Recurse Center
for their next cohorts. I figured I had about 4 or 6 months to focus on
learning as much as I could before then. (They hadn&rsquo;t started their
<a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/36-overlapping-batches">overlapping batches</a> yet).</p>

<hr>

<p>A couple of things, here.</p>

<p>First, <em>Thank you, Mary</em>. She didn&rsquo;t have to get back to me, she didn&rsquo;t have to
give me that feedback. Without it I would have felt a <em>lot</em> more discouraged. I
almost definitely wouldn&rsquo;t have reapplied to either program, and it&rsquo;s
debateable whether or not I would have continued to pursue programming <em>at
all</em>. At this point, I had invested only a couple of months in it, and it was a
pretty off the wall lark to begin with. That email really contributed to
getting me where I&rsquo;m at today, which is a place that was <em>completely
incomprehensible</em> to me a few years ago. She knows this; I&rsquo;ve told her.</p>

<p>Second, <em>they don&rsquo;t give feedback like this to applicants anymore.</em> There are
very good reasons for this, most notably that the volume of applicants has
increased quite a bit, but also that since my batch, they&rsquo;ve switched to having
alumni volunteers conduct a lot of the interviews. The facilitators spent an
enormous amount of time conducting interviews before this change, and to add
the overhead of providing focused, thoughtful feedback for <em>every single
application</em> was not possible. This is a bummer, yes, but I do understand it.
This is just to say that if you apply and don&rsquo;t get in, it might very well be
worth another shot.</p>

<p>Third, and most importantly, this timeline allowed me to set aside the myriad
doubts and worries I had about the whole thing for a few months, and to just
focus on programming <em>only</em>. I decided that I would spend that time, that 4-6
months, learning as much as I could, and if I didn&rsquo;t get in again, well, then
I&rsquo;d reassess, and at least I would have learned some new skills. Normally I
wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do this, normally I would waffle back and forth
about what the point of it was.</p>

<hr>

<p>And so I spent what turned out to be those 4 months <em>working my ass off</em>. I
treated it very much like a job, I spent at least 8 hours a day studying. I
found out about the <a href="http://www.wix.com/lounge/new-york">Wix lounge</a> which, at
the time, was free to anyone anytime working on pretty much anything. This was
pretty wild, but such a godsend! To have a place to go to for this expressed
purpose was so helpful to help me focus!</p>

<p>Nobody was supporting me during this period. I had no trust fund, and no
savings, and no work save the work I made or found for myself. I did random
photography and music gigs, and I had spent the year previous building up my
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/guitar-from-the-ground-up-new-york">teaching business</a>, and I
had just enough clients to keep my rent paid. I had to be frugal, and I was
still struggling financially, but I didn&rsquo;t have to work too many <em>hours</em>. I had
a <em>lot</em> of time, and I spent it at the Wix lounge, drinking their free coffee
and learning to program.</p>

<hr>

<p>I had this idea that Rails was the &ldquo;way in&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what most of the bootcamps
taught, after all, and I had already invested a relatively significant amount
of time learning Ruby, so  I spent a month or so working through <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Michael
Hartl&rsquo;s Rails tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>This was interesting and I learned a lot, but I didn&rsquo;t have a way to
contextualize anything yet. It moves pretty fast, so by the end I felt like I
was just typing things in until they worked. That&rsquo;s&hellip; <em>a</em> way to learn things,
but it&rsquo;s not ideal, and not very sticky.</p>

<p>The page that I hosted the final product on is still up, as it turns out! You
can sign up for an account <a href="https://derplederp.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I named it &ldquo;Derple Derp&rdquo; so that my screen didn&rsquo;t just always say &ldquo;SAMPLE APP&rdquo;
in giant letters while I was working on it.</p>

<p>Sometime in here I read
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">Code</a>
which was a seminal step. Please read this book, at least the first half, it is
amazing. It starts from nothing, from <code>1</code>&rsquo;s and <code>0</code>&rsquo;s, and explains what code
<em>is</em> and how it <em>works</em> and it&rsquo;s just really good and it made me understand a
lot of things that I didn&rsquo;t think were accessible to me, is all. Fundamental
things about computing and about encoding and about logic. I wrote a
<a href="/the-story-so-far">post</a> around this time about where I was at, and going back
and reading it now makes me appreciate the value of writing posts at all if
only for my future self. I&rsquo;ll never have access to that particular perspective
again.</p>

<hr>

<p>As I did these more structured things, I was also trying to stay open to small
projects and nerd snipes as they occured to me. This can be hard to do
sometimes, because going off on a tangent to try some random thing out can feel
off focus, it can feel like you&rsquo;re not making real progress, and just faffing
about. But in cases where it was really something I wanted to do, and in light
of Mary&rsquo;s feedback, I listened to myself. I wrote a <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyks/versions/0.0.5">ruby
gem</a> that models a
rubik&rsquo;s cube, and that could solve it from an arbitrary position, and tried to
turn it into a webapp of some sort. It became (quickly
obvious)[<a href="https://github.com/urthbound/rubyksonrails">https://github.com/urthbound/rubyksonrails</a>] that rails was completely
overkill for what I was trying to do, so I swtiched to a lightweight framework
called <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> that I had read about in Peter
Cooper&rsquo;s Beginning Ruby book.</p>

<p>Using a combination of the generated 3d css from a nifty tool a friend of mine
showed me (<a href="http://tridiv.com/">tridiv</a>), Sinatra, the ruby gem I made, and a
willingness to bang my head against something for a really long time until it
kind of worked, I managed to make a 3d online rubik&rsquo;s cube <a href="http://rubykscube.herokuapp.com/">simulation</a></p>

<p>I had so much fun doing this project that I followed the white rabbit straight
into <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page">esolang</a> territory, and wrote my
Fizzbuzz for my second application in Brainfuck, which I wrote about
extensively <a href="/fizzbuzz-in-brainfuck-part-one/">here</a>, and which to this very
day wins the prize for most pointless thing I&rsquo;m most proud of accomplishing in
my programming life.</p>

<p>At some point a little after that I got an email about applications being open
again at Hacker School, and I applied again. I was interviewed by
<a href="http://akaptur.com/">Allison</a> for the first round. We talked about my
fizzbuzz; it went well. I was interviewed by Mary again for the second, pairing
round. I was very nervous, after all, she had rejected me the first time! But
this also put her in an excellent position to triangulate my progress. We
looked at my Rubyks cube webapp together. I remember Mary interrupting me to
say &ldquo;Jeff, you&rsquo;ve just improved <em>so much</em>, it&rsquo;s really remarkable!&rdquo; and I was
so, so happy to hear that. I still hadn&rsquo;t told almost anyone about what I was
doing. It had been many months at this point; I was becoming exhausted.</p>

<hr>

<p>And that was that. A few days later, the night before my first holiday trip
to Denmark in 2013, on the way to teaching a lesson in Soho, I got an email
telling me I had gotten in. I was ecstatic, I may have cried a little, because
I was being told that I was good enough, and that my work was worth something,
and that everything was going to turn out ok, and it did.</p>

<hr>

<p>My batch started in mid-February the next year. I never did reapply to App
Academy.  I think it would have been good, but I&rsquo;m glad things worked out the
way they did.</p>
