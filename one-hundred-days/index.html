                    <p>Today is the one hundredth consecutive day that I have pushed <a href="https://github.com/urthbound">to github</a>. In fact, this very post is the push that ticked that box. My original plan was to grow my gnarly beard until I made it&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeywithamirror/14578033991" title="Beardo by Jeff Fowler, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3858/14578033991_26e8210480_q.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Beardo"></a></p>

<p>&hellip;but I couldn&rsquo;t stick to that one; it&rsquo;s probably for the best.</p>

<p>One hundred days! A sea of green!! Coming in to Hacker School, this was one of the only concrete goals I had- I didn&rsquo;t know for sure what I would be focusing on, but I knew I wanted to remain productive. Even though some of those days are nothing more than setting up a repo for a project I had been thinking about, I did managed to keep to my goal- and most of them are full of real, productive commits.</p>

<p>I do wish I had been blogging more, through the whole experience, but honestly- it really took all of my time and energy to keep coding. Also, it&rsquo;s only really right now that I have finally set up a site that I like with a workflow that sits well on a url that is <em>actually my name</em>. And now, armed with hindsight, I think I&rsquo;ll be able to write a <em>little</em> more eloquently about the process and experience I have had here, even if some of the details are smudged over&hellip; (but spoiler: it was, and remains (still a couple of weeks left, after all! (plus alumni week (which totally counts (can you tell I&rsquo;ve been learning a lisp?)))) a truly, and profoundly rewarding, and life-altering experience, and I look forward to writing deeply about <em>that</em> very much).</p>

<p>In the meantime, this is the post that was the commit that was the push that achieved a tangible goal. Woot!</p>
